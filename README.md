# Berkeley AI Project-3 ReinforcementLearning
### Files I edited:

valueIterationAgents.py: A value iteration agent for solving known MDPs.

qlearningAgents.py: Q-learning agents for Gridworld, Crawler and Pacman.

analysis.py: A file to put your answers to questions given in the project.

### Files read but did NOT edited:

mdp.py: Defines methods on general MDPs.

learningAgents.py: Defines the base classes ValueEstimationAgent and QLearningAgent, which your agents will extend.

util.py: Utilities, including util.Counter, which is particularly useful for Q-learners.

gridworld.py: The Gridworld implementation.

featureExtractors.py: Classes for extracting features on (state,action) pairs. Used for the approximate Q-learning agent (in qlearningAgents.py).
